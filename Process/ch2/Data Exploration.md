- Qualitative (Categorial) Attributes / Quantitative (Numeric) Attributes
- Descriptive Statistics
- Plot Types : histogram, boxplot, bell curve (normal dis), bar chart, line chart, pie/donut chart, sunburst chart, scatter plot, parallel chart, deviation chart

## Qualitative (Categorical) Attributes
### Nominal
- Values represent different categories or labels without any inherent order or ranking
- they are often used to represent names or labels associated with objects
- example : colors, jobs, animals
- statistics : mode, entropy, correlation
- Binomial : only 2 possible values (0/1)
- Polynomial : more than 2 possible values
### Ordinal
- Values process a **meaningful order or ranking**, but the magnitude between values is not precisely quantified (not known)
- statistics : median, percentile
- example : grades, shirt size
## Quantitative (Numeric) Attributes
### Interval
- an interval scaled attribute has values, whose differences are interpretable. Lacks true zero (zero point doesn't signify the complete absence of the value being measured)
- like when a temperature of 10C shouldn't be considered as twice as hot as 5 degrees C (cuz it would conflict for other types of temp measurements, like when converting to F, its not twice as hot anymore)
- statistics : mean, stdev
- example : temperature (0C doesnt mean theres no temperature), pH scale, exam score
### Ratio
- includes true zero, the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation
- like when a weight of 4 grams is twice as heavy as weight of 2 grams
- example : age (0 year means beginning of life), money, height
